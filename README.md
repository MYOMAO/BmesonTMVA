### Please Read the Following Instruction to Get Started ###

This repository is made to run TMVA package to apply machine learning on our newly process Bs and B+ CMS 2017 pp 5.02 TeV datasets in order to select optimal signal out from the background. If you successfully run the codes, you should be able to find the optimal working points for the B mesons, which will apply in our pp analysis

Some rename of the codes may need to be done since some of the codes' names are a little weird. Nonetheless, for the moment, let's stick to the names now and see if we can get the fits on the B mesons done.  

## To START ##

To get start, first clone the repository from github:

git clone https://github.com/MYOMAO/BmesonTMVA.git

Then go to the Bs folder by doing

cd Bs

Then do 

ls

You should see
